<h1> My All Time Fav Movies</h1>
<h2> Top 3 movies of 2023 </h2>
<hr />  
<h3> 1. Intouchables </h3>
<p> 
    I've watched this movie more than 10 times.<br />
    First, I've seen this in probably around 8 years ago or something. The movie is about handicapped millionare whose body is numb but head, so he looks for caretaker and one black young man appeared only to use interview for something. But the millionare likes him only because he is different and has energy and body that he doesn't have.

<h3> 2. Green Book </h3>
<p>I love how this movie is about the idea of everyone is equal and one can be changed for good only if he/she knows the whole story and reasoning.</p>

<h3> 3. The Time Traveler's Wife</h3>
<p>This is one of few many movies that have seen my tears in the end. This movie has a good combination of time travel (fiction), drama, and heart warming scenes</p>
